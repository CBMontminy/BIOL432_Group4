# Bonferroni correction
```{r}
# load library
library(tidyverse)

# load dataframe that contains p-value column 
DataP=read.csv("protein_diff_reg.csv")
```

# Run Bonferonni 
```{r}
# Change DataP$p_value to correspond with your dataframe and p-value column name 
pAdj <- p.adjust(DataP$p_value, method = 'bonferroni')
```

# Subset dataframe to only include significant p-values
```{r}
# I selected a 0.05 cut-off, but may have to change that based on our results 
DataP %>% 
  mutate(p_adjusted=pAdj) %>%
  filter(p_adjusted <= 0.05)
```

- let me (Marin) know when you get to this part. 
- I think we could run g:profiler on the list of significant genes to see if there are any trends.
