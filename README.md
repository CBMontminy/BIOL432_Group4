This dataset shows the regulatory landscape of the yeast phosphoproteome, showing the regulation/change in abundance of genes based on different stress treatments. The dataset contains information on the gene names, reading frames, different samples, and abundance of proteins expressed when Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to certain stresses. We want to examine overlap in specific gene regulation between different stressors in order to assess which genes are most critical for resilience to deal with multiple stressors.  As of now, we plan to look at both heat and cold stress: 23°C and 42°C, as well as pH and osmolarity stress. These stressors are typical environmental stressors and the response would indicate survivability.  We will use machine learning to determine which genes are the most up or down regulated.  We will view overlap of the gene regulation across stressors.  From this data, we will determine gene function to better understand why they are regulated in the way that they are.

We hypothesize that there will be little overlap between changes in gene regulation across three or more stressors.  We do predict that there will be overlap between heat and cold stress, but likely no overlap outside of that. Genes are typically very specific, and it is unlikely that genes would be used for differing stressors.  However, any overlap we find would indicate potential genes that are involved in the stress response, regardless of what the specific stressor is.

Climate change is the largest threat of the modern age. Large fluctuations in temperature coupled with increasing acidity, salinity and heavy metal concentrations in the soil are intensifying organism exposure to various stressors. By understanding the impact of climate change stressors on gene expression in the model organism S. cerevisiae, our group will identify specific genes key to adaptive survival.
